      <description>Topics: Docker
I have been wanting to learn more about Docker for months. However, when starting to read Dockers get started page I quickly had to find out that I&amp;rsquo;m lacking knowledge in too many other concepts. Since my background isn&amp;rsquo;t computer science I often run across this problem. Luckily, this allows me to constantly learn new things! After writing a post on virtual machines and another about containers this one is finally about Docker!</description>

With the goal of eventually reaching the topic of Docker, this post will introduce virtual machines, while the next one will be about containers.</description>
